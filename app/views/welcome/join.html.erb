Why join IEEE?

- access to publications (many kinds and many formats) at a reduced rate
- opportunity to participate in technical committees
- conferences at a reduced rate
- access to Books 24/7 and ELementK for technology learning

Beyond the technical information, there is the professional development aspect.  Certification in software engineering.

Beyond that, professional networking.  Join a local chapter, network with your peers, be part of the technical professional community.  Assume leadership responsibility, work on committees, learn non technical skills.
